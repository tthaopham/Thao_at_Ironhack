7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.
Social media such as Facebook and Pinterest are doing well in terms of total rating count. That could signify large user base. Classic games such as Angry Birds, Solitaire, Pac Man still can engage with users. Other than that, daily utitilies have good user base too.

8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.
In terms of rating individually, apps for physical & mental health are well rated; perhaps, they are showing results to consumers.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see? 
Top rating does not correlate/ corresponse to total rating count

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?
Perhaps the total users * averate rating (though will be highly skewed by sheer size of user)

11. Do people care about the price of an app?Â 
Data does not seem to show any correlation as very few price points vs free apps vs total rating
