# Lab | Functional programming

## Introduction

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. Let's practice on this approach!


## Getting Started
Register [here] (https://www.codewars.com/)  and [here] (https://www.codingame.com/).

You are more than suggested to practice with katas on those websites, it helps you to set up your mind and improve your coding skills.

As they say: 5 katas per day keep the coronavirus away (Actually it is truth, since you spend more time in front of your laptops :D)

And as for now - please join the kata challenge.
